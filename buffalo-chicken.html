    <h2>Boneless Wings</h2>
    <p>This boneless wings recipe is easy to make with chunks of tender chicken lightly breaded and fried until golden and crispy, then slathered in homemade Buffalo Sauce. Better than any restaurant!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chicken Breast. </strong>Boneless, skinless chicken breast is best for making boneless chicken wings. You can use chicken thigh, but the breast meat is so much better.</li>
        <li><strong>Flour. </strong>For breading the boneless wings.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings. </strong>I typically use my homemade Cajun seasonings for this, plus salt and pepper, but you can use your favorites. What's your secret seasoning blend of choice? Got a favorite?</li>
        <li><strong>Egg.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Buttermilk. </strong>You can also use milk instead.</li>
        <li><strong>Oil. </strong>For frying.</li>
        <li><strong>Butter.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Hot Sauce. </strong>Use a good Louisiana style hot sauce. Franks is very popular, though I often use Valentina HOT.</li>
        <li><strong>Vinegar. </strong>I use apple cider vinegar, but white vinegar is great, too.</li>
        <li><strong>Worcestershire Sauce. </strong>Flavor bomb, my friends!</li>
        <li><strong>For Serving. </strong>Blue cheese dressing or ranch dressing, celery sticks.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><h3>Create your breading station.</h3></li>
        <p>Stir together the flour, salt and pepper and seasonings in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, beat together the egg and buttermilk until combined.</p>
        <li><h3>Bread the boneless wings.</h3></li>
        <p>Dip each chicken piece into the egg mixture, then into the seasoned flour mixture. Repeat, then set onto a plate to rest for 10 minutes. For extra crispy boneless chicken wings, dip the breaded chicken nuggets one more time into the flour mixture before frying them</p>
        <li><h3>Fry the boneless wings.</h3></li>
        <p>Heat several inches of frying oil heated to 350 degrees F in a large pot or Dutch oven. Do not boil. Fry the boneless wings for 5-6 minutes, or until golden brown and cooked through.
            They should register 165 degrees F internally when measured with a meat thermometer. You can use a deep fryer to deep fry the chicken as well.</p>
        <li><h3>Drain the boneless wings.</h3></li>
        <p>Remove and set onto a paper towel lined plate or baking sheet to drain excess oil.</p>
        <li><h3>Heat and whisk.</h3></li>
        <p>Heat the butter, hot sauce, vinegar and Worcestershire sauce in a sauce pan until the butter melts. Whisk vigorously until the sauce thickens up. Add to a small bowl.</p>
        <li><h3>Sauce them boneless chicken wings!</h3></li>
        <p>Slather the boneless wings with homemade Buffalo sauce and serve with blue cheese dressing or ranch dressing as a dipping sauce and celery sticks on the side.</p>
    </ol>
